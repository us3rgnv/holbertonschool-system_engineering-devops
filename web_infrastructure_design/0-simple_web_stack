# 0. Simple Web Stack

## Web Infrastructure Design for [www.foobar.com](http://www.foobar.com)

### 1. User Request Flow

When a user wants to access the website:

1. The user types `www.foobar.com` in their browser.
2. The browser queries the Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve `www.foobar.com` to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
3. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server at 8.8.8.8.

### 2. Components of the Infrastructure

#### Server

* A **server** is a computer or virtual machine that hosts services accessible over a network.
* In this case, the server hosts the web server, application server, application files, and the database.

#### Domain Name

* The **domain name** (`foobar.com`) is a human-readable address that maps to the server’s IP address.
* The `www` in `www.foobar.com` is a **CNAME or A record** in DNS pointing to the IP of the server.

#### Web Server

* The **web server** (Nginx) handles HTTP requests from clients.
* It serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS) and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

#### Application Server

* The **application server** processes business logic and runs the application code.
* It generates dynamic content, interacts with the database, and responds back to the web server.

#### Application Files

* The **application files** include the website code: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side scripts.

#### Database

* The **database** (MySQL) stores and manages structured data used by the application.
* The application server queries the database to retrieve or store information.

#### Communication

* The server communicates with the user's computer using **HTTP or HTTPS** protocols over TCP/IP.

### 3. Issues with this Infrastructure

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**

   * If the server fails, the website becomes completely unavailable.

2. **Downtime During Maintenance**

   * Updating or deploying new code may require restarting the web server, causing temporary downtime.

3. **Scalability Limitations**

   * If too much traffic arrives, a single server cannot handle the load efficiently.
   * Cannot horizontally scale without additional infrastructure.

### Summary Diagram (Text Representation)

```
[User] --> DNS (www.foobar.com -> 8.8.8.8) --> [Server]
                                     |
                                     |--> Nginx (Web Server)
                                     |       |
                                     |       --> Application Server
                                     |               |
                                     |               --> MySQL Database
                                     |
                                     --> Application Files
```

This setup demonstrates a **simple one-server web stack**, which is straightforward but limited in terms of availability and scalability.

If you want, I can also create a **more visual ASCII diagram** that shows the flow from user to web server to app server to database—it looks much cleaner for whiteboard-style submissions.

Do you want me to do that?
